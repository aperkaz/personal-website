I hope this article shares some light on how to build better React components leveraging TypeScript. This post is an outcome of the efforts of building [taggr](https://taggr.ai/), the privacy-focused AI gallery.

While building [taggr](https://taggr.ai/), I got deeper into TypeScript, and so far I am loving the added capabilities for annotating types and catching errors at compile time, instead off at runtime.

It can feel daunting and extra work to annotate each component and function at first, but as the codebase grows in size and complexity, the benefits start to shine.

Having the components and business-logic code properly typed, keeps a unique source of truth for the entities of a domain, minimizing the human errors across the application layers.

Plus, TypeScript definitions can be automatically generated from [OpenAPI](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript), [GraphQL schemas](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript)… A total win-win 🎉

When building React components, I try to keep their APIs as tight and as clean as possible. 🧹💨

Components with clear boundaries are easy to re-use, extend and overall nice to work with.

Let’s analyze a concrete example of how we can do cleaner component APIs using TypeScript, shall we?

## Don’t expose Prop types from a component 😧

```typescript:paragraph.tsx
export type Props = {
  text: string;
};

const Paragraph = ({ text }: Props) => <p>{text}</p>;
```

```typescript:title.tsx
// Title is now tightly coupled to Paragraph.txs > Props
import { Props } from './paragraph';

const Title = ({ text }: Props) => <h1>{text}</h1>;
```

**Why is this bad?**

- When exposing the Prop types directly, nothing stops other developers (even your future self 😂) from importing and extending those types in other parts of the application. This breaks component’s encapsulation and creates unnecessary dependencies between components.
- Changes to the Prop types of the original component can potentially break other parts of the app 💥
- A cluttered API, the module exports the component and types. This can quickly turn into component files exporting multiple types, so be careful 🧐

## A better way ✅

Do not directly expose component Props types. **Don’t**.

_What if want to access the Props of another component, so I don’t have to re-declare domain-specific types?_

A component’s **Props** define the interface of the component with the rest of your application (or the world 🌎).

If you have a `UserProfile` component and the **Props** declare a `User` type that you want to use somewhere else in your app, it should be extracted out of the `UserProfile`.

Extract domain-specific types into `./types` so that they can be reused across the app.

```typescript:user-types.tsx
export interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

```typescript:user-profile.tsx
import {User} from './user-types';

type Props = {
  user: User,
  date: string, // other props
};

const UserProfile = ({user, date}: Props) => ...
export default UserProfile;
```

```typescript:user-list.tsx
import {User} from './user-types';

type Props = {
  users: User[],
};

const UserList = ({users}: Props) => ...
export default UserList;
```

**What if I need to get access to a component’s properties from somewhere else?**

They are valid reasons for wanting to access a component’s types, such as enhancing a component with [HOC](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/do-react-hooks-replace-higher-order-components-hocs-7ae4a08b7b58)s.

Lets check the next section to solve this!

## Prop type lookup ✨

We can leverage TypeScript’s type resolution, to enable Prop type lookup.

Setup prop type lookup helper, `GetComponentProps`:

```typescript:utils.ts
export type GetComponentProps<T> = T extends React.ComponentType<infer P> | React.Component<infer P> ? P : never;
```

Define the component that we want to extend, `Title`:

```typescript:title.tsx
type Color = 'RED' | 'BLUE' | 'GREEN';

type Props = {
  title: string;
  color: Color;
};

const Title = ({ title, color }: Props) => <h1 style={{ color }}>{title}</h1>;
export default Title;
```

Extend the Title component, while keeping full type safety:

```typescript:title-wrapper.tsx
import Title from './title';
import { GetComponentProps } from './utils';

type Props = GetComponentProps<typeof Title> & {
  onClick: () => void;
};

const TitleWrapper = ({ onClick, ...rest }: Props) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>
    <Title {...rest} />
  </button>
);
export default TitleWrapper;
```

```typescript:index.tsx
import TitleWrapper from 'title-wrapper'; // Full type safety and autocompletion! 🎉

const App = () => <TitleWrapper title="Hello there" color="GREEN" onClick={() => window.alert('title pressed')} />;
```

We managed to access the properties of `Title` from `TitleWrapper` , without manually exposing them and breaking encapsulation, great! 🎉
