When working with exteral APIs, I am a big fan of typing them in the client through schemas and runtime validation (with tools such as [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)).

With said tools, its possible to generate TypeScript types for dynamic objects (such as HTTP responses), with runtime assurances. 
Seriously, check [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) if you havent! 🦸‍♂️

Those types provide great DX, making the debugging of issues such as unexpected breaking changes in API responses, a breeze.

```typescript:example.ts
import { z } from "zod";

// the schema for user object
const userSchema = z.object({
  age: z.number(),
  name: z.string()
});

// untyped and dynamic objects (such as HTTP response)
const validResponse = {name: 'Bob', age: 43} as any;
const invalidResponse = 12 as any;

userSchema.parse(invalidResponse); 
// => throws ZodError ❌

const user = userSchema.parse(validResponse); 
// 👆 `user` will be automatically typed in TypeScript as `{age: number, name: string}`, since the payload complies with the schema
```

On a recent project, I encountered an API whose response was dynamically contructed based on the query parameters.

This provided example is a simplification, but it hopefully showcases the complexity if there where 100s of query parameters affecting the response payload shape.

```typescript:dynamic-API.ts
const responseA = await fetch('https://example.com/animals?q=dogs').then(r => r.json()); 
// 👆 {dogs: ['Alfie', 'Rudolf']}

const responseB = await fetch('https://example.com/animals?q=cats').then(r => r.json());
// 👆 {cats: [{name: 'Mit', age: 4}}

const responseC = await fetch('https://example.com/animals?q=dogs,cats').then(r => r.json());
// 👆 {dogs: ['Alfie', 'Rudolf'], cats: [{name: 'Mit', age: 4}]}
```

One could allways return back to not typing the response through schemas, but its would be a poor DX. 
So not an option 🤣

It turns out that an elegant solution is possible with zod's [pick](https://zod.dev/?id=pickomit) functionality (dynamically picking schema parts to apply):

```typescript:typed-dynamic-API.ts
/** Unique source of truth, typing the shape of all the API reponses */
const responseSchema = z.object({
  cats: z.array(z.string()),
  dogs: z.array(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number()
  })),
});
export type QueryParams = keyof z.infer<typeof responseSchema>; 
// 👆 "cats" | "dogs"

/** Will return a partial schema, based on schema's projerties named as `queryParams` */
export function getPartialSchema<T extends QueryParams[]>(queryParams: T) {
  const zodQuerySelector = queryParams.reduce(
    (previousValue, cur) => ({
      ...previousValue,
      [cur]: true,
    }),
    {}
  ) as { [Param in (typeof queryParams)[number]]: true };

  return responseSchema.pick(zodQuerySelector);
}
```

```typescript:usage-typed-dynamic-API.ts
import {QueryParams, getPartialSchema} from './typed-dynamic-API.ts';

const queryParams = ["dogs"] satisfies QueryParams[];

const response = await fetch(`https://example.com/animals?q=${queryParams.toString()}`).then(r => r.json()); 
// `response` is typed as `any` since its only known at runtime

const partialSchema = getPartialSchema(queryParams);
const animals = partialSchema.parse(response);
// 👆 `animals` will be automatically typed in TypeScript as `{dogs: {name: string, age: number}[]}`, if the response fulfilles the schema
```

Happy codding! 🎉
